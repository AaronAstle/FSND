# Neighborhood Map Project
---

## Overview

This project is for the Neighborhood Map portion of the Full Stack Nanodegree.

It will showcase the front end set of challenges by utilizing Google Maps, Foursquare Venue and
knockout.js to access the previously mentions API's.

The map will highlight a few of my favorite locations in the Sacramento Area.


## Getting Started

This project is workable by just cloning the parent [repo](https://github.com/AaronAstle/FSND-Projects) and accessing the `./project-5/index.html` file.


## Editing or Contributing

This project was constructed with the use of NPM and Gulp for the asset pipeline.

Source files are piped through to the `/dist` folder for consumption.  Any edits needed
should be made to the `/src` directory files.

After cloning this project in your command line tools run the following commands to get running locally.

`$ npm install`

`$ gulp`

Running the commands will get all of the assets located where needed to run the
javascript compiling and then you can access the page but opening the `project-5/index.html`
in your browser.
