# Movie Trailer Website
## Forked from Udacity ud036_StarterCode

Source code for a Movie Trailer website project.

My favorite movies are stored in a list of objects in `fav_movies.py`.  This 
list is created through the use of the `Movie()` class in the `media.py`.

To create a dynamically generated `*.html` file, in order to view in browsers, 
you must run the following command.

`$ python fav_movies.py`

This will take the list of movies, create the web page, and open a browser window.

If you want to change the movies on the list, you can just change the itesm in 
`fav_movies.py` file. Then rerun the above command.
